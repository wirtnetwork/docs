# Whats a public IP?

A public IP in Wirts sense is an IP on the internet that clearly identifies one specific device!

# Whats a private IP

This is an IP that all the devices in your network have and where they can find it each other. No one else in the entire internet can though. They have no meaning outside of your network!
