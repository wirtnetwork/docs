# Frequently asked questions

## Am I setting up a VPN?

Yes, this is a Virtual private network!

## Will I be anonymous on the internet?

No, traffic to the internet can go through the VPN, but since the server belongs only to you, that could be used to associate the server to you.
It is not less anonymous than not using it though, but definitely more secure.

## Do you keep logs?

We can not! The Webapp runs in your browser and if you set up the Wirt Bot yourself then all the data is in your hands!

## How can I trust you with my keys?

You dont! The keys and all configuration only lives inside your browser. Nothing ever leaves it, until you download it to configure your devices. Your keys are as safe as your browser is!

## Who is building this?

My name is [Maximilian Ehlers](https://ehlers.berlin). A developer living in Berlin.
I am currently back in university to finish my masters degree and develop this system simultaneously.
