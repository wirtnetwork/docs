# Frequently asked questions

## Whats a public IP?

A public IP is an IP address on the internet that clearly identifies one specific device!

## Whats a private IP

This is an IP that all the devices in your network have and where they can find it each other. No one else in the entire internet can though. They have no meaning outside of your network!

## Whats a port?

A port is a like an open door into a computer.

Programs open them up to receive data from other computers.

Servers that do a lot of networking might have many of them open, WirtBots only need to open 3 of them to keep unwanted data out!

## Am I setting up a VPN?

Yes, this is a Virtual private network!

## Will I be anonymous on the internet?

No, traffic to the internet can go through the VPN, but since the server belongs only to you, that could be used to associate the server to you.

It is not less anonymous than not using it though, but definitely more secure.

## Do you keep logs?

I can not! The UI runs in your browser and if you set up the WirtBot yourself then all the data is in your hands!

## How can I trust you with my keys?

No one has access to your keys except you. The keys and all configuration only lives inside your browser. Nothing ever leaves it, until you download it to configure your devices. Your keys are as safe as your browser is!
