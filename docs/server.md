# The server

The server is the central point of coordinating the communication between your devices.

At the moment you will have to provide your own server and configure it with Wireguard.
You do not need a very powerful machine for a normal private network, a simple low-end VPS should be okay.

We recommend [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) and are not affiliated with them. They just offer a good product!

If your network is very large you will probably know that it wont be enough in that case.

## Setup

To install Wireguard onto your server we recommend the [official documentation](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).

Also make sure that the port you choose for Wireguard is not blocked by your Firewall!.

### Configuring the server

After you have it installed Wireguard you can place the configuration file that you have created with **Wirt** into `/etc/wireguard` on your server.

If your server uses [systemd](https://systemd.io/) simply run `systemctl enable wg-quick@server` (server corresponds to `server.conf`, if you rename the file, you need to reflect this in the command as well). Your server is now successfully set up.

## Automatically updating your server from the Wirt webapp

Lets face it, your network will undergo changes. New devices have to be added when you start a new project or want to invite someone, old ones haves to be deleted.
While its easy to delete the devices you will face the problem of keeping your server up to date with these changes. After all, if the server does not know a device it wont allow it to connect.

The [wirt-adapter](https://github.com/wirt-network/adapter) solves exactly this problem, at least if you are running the server on **Linux**.

It will be connected to your [wirt](https://wirt.network) web-app via private/public key encryption and then listen to any changes and apply them.

In order to do this securely, it makes a few assumptions:

- You have a domain name that points to your server and a valid SSL certificate
- You have provided the public key of your web-app
- Your wireguard configuration is at `/etc/wireguard/server.conf` and is editable by the adapter

Below is some more information on this.

More installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/wirt-network/adapter).

Once installed simply enter the domain name your server is reachable at on the [wirt settings page](https://wirt.network/settings), enable the connection and you are good to go.

### Domain and SSL certificate

In order to use the `wirt-adapter` you **MUST** have a domain name that points to your server and a valid SSL certificate.
This is needed because otherwise your browser will not allow communicating with the adapter. All requests would simply be blocked.

If you do not have a certificate yet head over to [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get a free one!

There is nothing that can be done from our site. If you have a workaround using a proxy or similar, feel free to contribute your solution to the docs!

### Public key from the web app

Over on the [wirt settings page](https://wirt.network/settings) there is an option to generate keys that identify the webapp as soon as you configured your server.

These are generated in webassembly and never leave your browser! This is the only way to ensure that no one else will start changing your server configuration.
Once generated the public key will be displayed and you can copy it to configure the `wirt-adapter` service file.

Why is this needed?

The webapp will send the configuration together with a signature on every request. This signature is created with your webapps private key.
This means that the configuration is verifiably from you! Anyone else who sends a request to your server wont be able to generate a valid signature and the request will be denied.

#### How can I trust this?

The [wirt-adapter](https://github.com/wirt-network/adapter) is completely open source. If you like you can audit the code yourself.

On the webapp part its the same old reason. Everything is in your browser, nothing leaves. If the adapter is not set up, no API calls will ever be made.
And once it is setup you can always inspect what gets sent out.

### Systemd

Currently the adapter only supports restarting wireguard servers that are spun up using [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg-quick.8) together with `systemd`. This adds much simplicity to the workflow!

Since the config is at `/etc/wireguard/server.conf` simply start the server with `systemctl start wg-quick@server`. Thats it!

### Restarting Wireguard

The `wirt-adapter` repository includes a script that can take care of this for you.
It will listen to any changes that the `wirt-adapter` makes to the configuration file and restart wireguard automatically.

Installation instructions are at https://github.com/wirtnetwork/adapter/#automatically-restarting-wireguard .

### Firewall rules

As you may have noticed, [wirt](https://wirt.network) does not yet support all of [wireguards](https://wireguard.com) configuration options, such as `PostUp` and `PostDown`.

This means that you have to make sure that your firewall is set up correctly to allow traffic to flow on your wireguard interfaces and the port that it is listening on!

In the future when more features get added to the webapp, this shouldnt be needed anymore.

### Editing privileges

First of all **DO NOT RUN THE ADAPTER AS SUDO!**

While the [wirt-adapter](https://github.com/wirt-network/adapter) is written with security in mind, using one of the most secure programming languages (https://www.rust-lang.org/), bugs and errors can always exist. Do not take the shortcut here! After all the network should be secure, right?

So how can you do it properly?

### Allow changing the config

- First you should create a new user. How to do this will depend on your distribution. Lets assume the name is `wirt-adapter`
- Create a new group called `wirt-editors`
- Add your user to this group
- Change the permissions on the `/etc/wireguard/server.conf` file to allow the group to write to it: `chmod 660 /etc/wireguard/server.conf`
- Give `wirt-editors` ownership of the config file: `chown root:wirt-editors /etc/wireguard/server.conf`
- Lastly allow `wirt-editors` to access the `/etc/wireguard` directory: `chown root:wirt-editors /etc/wireguard && chmod 770 /etc/wireguard`

## Can we help you with this?

In the future we might be able to provide tools and services to do this quickly and fully automated.
More info will come along when we can be sure that everything works smoothly and is secure.
