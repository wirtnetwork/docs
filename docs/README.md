# What is Wirt?

Wirt is a system to allow secure communication between any devices you might have - over the internet.

It is designed in 2 parts, a WirtBotÂ® that is easily reachable via the internet and the WirtUI to configure.

- Head over [here](/docs/how-does-it-work) to understand how it works.
- Check out [this page](/docs/setup) to set it up yourself
- The [FAQ page](/docs/setup) should hopefully answer any other questions
