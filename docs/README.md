# Welcome to the Wirt documentation

**Wirt** is an application to help you to create a network with your devices in a safe way using Wireguard.
There are many use cases for this, as the tutorials will cover, but a secure network is at the base of all of those.

Since Wireguard is behind all the actual networking and routing your network will be using modern cryptography and some Linux magic, to give you the quickest and most reliable solution for creating you own personal **VPN**.

You read that right, a **VPN**, but not in the way that you might have come to know it from the countless piracy related news. This **Virtual private network** that you will set up with Wirt belongs only to you and will no communicate with any devices outside of it.
This will give you a maximum of security, allowing you to connect to your devices from home while you are on the go or travelling, staying anonymous between your devices in any network and making configuration of many services you might want to use for yourself a lot easier since you do not have to worry about other people or bots joining **YOUR** network.
And dont worry, you can still decide to route all your traffic through your server. But be aware that this might not make you anonymous on the internet, its your server after all.

So who is Wirt for?

- Everyone who already digitalized their home and wants to acces their data while on the go.
- Wireguard enthusiasts who want a user friendly UI to manage their network.
- Security conscious users who lack the technical knowledge to set up Wireguard on their own.

Hopefully **Wirt** can help you stay safe!

<!-- TODO: link to the tutorials -->

Over time the tutorials in this documentation will grow, when we add some, or people such as yourself come up with new ideas on what to do. Please share your projects with us. This documentation can be edited at https://github.com/wirtnetwork/docs/ .

<!-- TODO: link to explanations  -->

If you would like a better understanding on how this private network works and what makes it powerful head to our beginner friendly explanation.
Should you know these things already and just want to know if we are selling you a secure product or just another rotten codebase go to the detailed explanation, which should hopefully address those concerns.

Any questions remaining? Contact us directly at contact `at` wirt.network.

<!-- TODO: add contact email -->.

We hope to add a forum in the future, but right now we are busy programming a secure way for you set up a server automatically!
