# What a port?

A port is a like an open door into a computer.

Programs open them up to receive data from other computers.

Servers that do a lot of networking might have many of them open, Wirt robots only open 2 of them to keep unwanted data out!

## Port 22

This is the port that most programmers use to enter their virtual workspace.
Is is used to manage servers all around the world and is the standard for this.

## Port 21212

This is where WireGuard(TODO: Trademark) is doing its magic.

# No worries about ports with Wirt

Good think you do not have to care about leaving the wrong ports open in your Wirt network.

Its an extension of your home network! As long as the device that is transmitting the data is inside your home network and has no public ip (TODO: link) it will only open these ports to your home and Wirtual network.

The same of course applies for the networks of your business.
