## What can I do with Wirt?

Ever wanted to run your own cloud at home, where all your data stays in your vicinity but is still available to you anywhere in the world? For all your data or just your most sensitive documents?
No problem.

Need to securely monitor your infrastructure but dont want to add messy authentification to all the endpoints?
No problem.

Want to connect your massive DataCenters over geographical locations?
That might be a problem.

As you can see Wirt is a good system for any of your projects that need secure communication over the internet up to a certain scale.

Over that scale, especially if you need high network resilience, you should probably do more research into WireGuardÂ® and then decide if Wirt can help you!
I will be happy to assist you in your initial consideration phase for a fee.

I hope to add a few tutorials in the future, but would of course appreciate any help with this. So if you have a project that was suddenly easily doable because of Wirt please let me know!
Maybe we can work on adding it to this documentation?
