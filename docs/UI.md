# WirtUI

## Backup

The WirtUI only runs in your browser, and its data is never synced to any servers.

This is done to ensure your data privacy, but also means that you are responsible for making regular backups of your data.

To do this use the `Create Backup` function in the settings of your [Dashboard](https://wirt.network/dashboard)

## Authentification

Your WirtUI and WirtBotÂ® are both under your control.
During the WirtBot setup they are linked using cryptogrpahic keys whch ensures that no other UI can configure your WirtBot.

Because of this there is no reason to have an account with any backend on the internet.
By opening [wirt.network](https://wirt.network) you are using your personalized version already.

## Mutliple networks

If you have multiple networks that you need to manage, simply save them as different backups and reimport them whenever you want to continue configuring them.
