# How does it work?

The Wirt robot uses something called WireGuard(TODO: Trademark) to establish secure connections between your devices.

WireGuard(TODO: Link) uses state of the art cryptography and extremely rigorous programming to ensure that your data flows fast and securely.
Only devices that you add to the network can receive data that is meant to be sent to them by other devices in the network.

Wirt.network is the interface to interact with your Wirt Robot. It uses state of the art web programming techniques to make configuration of your Wirt possible in a safe manner.
