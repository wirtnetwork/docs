# What can I do with Wirt?

A private Google(TODO: Trademark) for your business, a personal Netflix for your family, securing data in your distributed systems. Wirt will enable you to do all of it.

We even have some tutorials right here:

- link to Nextcloud
- link to Netflix

But that is of course not all. You probably even know better than us. What would you put into your personal cloud? Wirt allows you to do it securely.

And if you would ever like to share your project check out the subreddit.
