# Wirt documentation

This repository houses the documentation for https://wirt.network .

Feel free to contribute to it if you think something is missing or you have a great tutorial!

## Contributing

There is not much to it. Create a new [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) file in the docs folder, and add it to the sidebar in `docs/.vuepress/config.js`.

When you are done open a [Pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#pull-request) and target it to the development branch! Once it is reviewed and everything looks good it will be merged and soon appear on the website.

If you need any help simply open an issue!
